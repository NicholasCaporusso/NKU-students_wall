# Students' wall
This is a collaborative project that features all the students who have taken my INF286 - Introduction to Web Development course.

Check the webpage out at https://nicholascaporusso.github.io/students-wall/

## Instructions for students:
1. Email me your GitHub username, so I can enable you to modify the repository
2. Clone the repository into a folder (i.e., `git clone https://github.com/NicholasCaporusso/students-wall.git .`)
3. Create a webpage using the provided template and save the file under the students folder as `Year-Semester-INF-286-Section-Firstname-Lastname.html` (e.g., 2021-Spring-INF-286-002-Nicholas-Caporusso.html`)
4. Create asquare image and save it into the `students` folder as `Year-Semester-INF-286-Section-Firstname-Lastname.png` (e.g., 2021-Spring-INF-286-002-Nicholas-Caporusso.png`)
5. Open the file `students/students.js` and add your name to the list as follows: `Year-Semester-INF-286-Section-Firstname-Lastname` (e.g., 2021-Spring-INF-286-002-Nicholas-Caporusso`). **Make sure you wrap the name into single quotes and that it is preceded by a comma**
6. Create a commit (i.e., `git add .` and `git commit -m 'Firstname Lastname added their material'`)
7. Push your repository (i.e., `git push`)

### Troubleshooting
If you get an error message saying that the remote repository contains more up-to-date content with respect to your local repository, do the following:
1. `git pull`
2. `git push`
