		<h5 class="mt-1">What I enjoyed of the class</h5>
		I am a huge fan of sharing content and things tht people crete so I enjoyed learning about Git hub this semester and gaining the ability to share my work with otehrs and see other peoples work.
		<h5 class="mt-1">What I learned in the class</h5>
		in the beginning of this year I didnt know anything about html, web development, and how to make our web pages open to the public. I was truly fascinated by the ability to write a couple strings of code then refresh the page and have immediate results. we learned all the necessary elements it takes to construct a healthy web page. One that is easy to navigate and is strigth too the point.
